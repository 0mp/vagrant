  Welcome to the CI for <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>, a tool
  for building and distributing virtualized environments. In order to maintain
  a level of stability that users of Vagrant have come to expect, this
  CI system will run a wide range of tests against all commits to the
  <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant">Vagrant project</a>.
