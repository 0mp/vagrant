    If VirtualBox is installed, you may need to tweak the paths to the `VBoxManage`

    The following shows how to configure VirtualBox. This can be done in the
    Vagrantfile. Note that 90% of the time, you shouldn't need to do this if VirtualBox
    is installed. Please use the various Vagrant support lines to request more information
    if you can't get this working.

    If you just recently installed VirtualBox, make sure you've launched

    file.

    Otherwise, you may need to set the path to the VirtualBox.xml file
    manually. Note that 90% of people should never have to do this, so
    don't be afraid to use the various Vagrant support lines to ask for
    help. To set the path manually:

    VirtualBox::Global.vboxconfig = \"/path/to/VirtualBox.xml\""

    To fix this, modify your current projects Vagrantfile to use another

:vm_ssh_auth_failed: "SSH authentication failed! While this could be due to a variety of reasons,
    the two most common are: private key path is incorrect or you're using a box
    which was built for Vagrant 0.1.x.

    Vagrant 0.2.x dropped support for password-based authentication. If you're
    tring to `vagrant up` a box which does not support Vagrant's private/public
    keypair, then this error will be raised. To resolve this, read the guide
    on converting base boxes from password-based to keypairs here:

    http://vagrantup.com/docs/converting_password_to_key_ssh.html

    If the box was built for 0.2.x and contains a custom public key, perhaps
    the path to the private key is incorrect. Check your `config.ssh.private_key_path`."
