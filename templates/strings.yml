:box_download_http_socket_error: |-
  An error occurred while trying to download the specified box. This most
  often happens if there is no internet connection or the address is
  invalid.

  Box URL: <%= box_url %>
:box_file_exists: |-
  The specified output file for packaging already exists. Please move
  the file or modify the output filename parameter then try to package
  again.

  Specified output file: <%= output_file %>
:box_remove_doesnt_exist: |-
  The box you're attempting to remove does not exist!
:box_repackage_doesnt_exist: |-
  The box you're attempting to repackage does not exist. Please check the
  name you specified and try again. As a reminder, the repackage
  command is for repackaging boxes which have been added through `vagrant box add`
  but the box has been lost.
:chef_base_invalid_provisioner: |-
  Vagrant::Provisioners::Chef is not a valid provisioner! Use ChefSolo or ChefServer instead.
:chef_server_url_required: |-
  Chef server provisioning requires that the `config.chef.chef_server_url` be set to the
  URL of your chef server. Examples include "http://12.12.12.12:4000" and
  "http://myserver.com:4000" (the port of course can be different, but 4000 is the default)
:chef_server_validation_key_required: |-
  Chef server provisioning requires that the `config.chef.validation_key_path` configuration
  be set to a path on your local machine of the validation key used to register the
  VM with the chef server.
:chef_server_validation_key_doesnt_exist: |-
  The validation key set for `config.chef.validation_key_path` does not exist! This
  file needs to exist so it can be uploaded to the virtual machine. It is
  currently set to "<%= Vagrant.config.chef.validation_key_path %>"
:chef_not_detected: |-
  The `<%= binary %>` binary appears to not be in the PATH of the guest. This
  could be because the PATH is not properly setup or perhaps chef is not
  installed on this guest. Chef provisioning can not continue without
  chef properly installed.
:command_box_invalid: |-
  Please specify a valid action to take on the boxes, either
  `add` or `remove`. Examples:

  vagrant box add name uri
  vagrant box remove name
  vagrant box list
:dotfile_error: |-
  The dotfile which Vagrant uses to store the UUID of the project's
  virtual machine already exists and is not a file! The dotfile is
  currently configured to be `<%= env.dotfile_path %>`

  To change this value, please see `config.vagrant.dotfile_name`

  Are you trying to use Vagrant from your home directory? This is the
  leading cause of this error message. To resolve this, simply use a
  different directory. Or, if you really want to run Vagrant from your
  home directory, modify the `config.vagrant.dotfile_name` configuration
  key.
:downloader_file_doesnt_exist: |-
  The given box does not exist on the file system:

  <%= source_url %>
:package_requires_export: |-

:provisioner_invalid_class: |-

:provisioner_unknown_type: |-
  Unknown provisioner type: <%= provisioner %>
:ssh_bad_exit_status: |-
  The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
  Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

  <%= command %>
:system_invalid_class: |-
  The specified system does not inherit from `Vagrant::Systems::Base`. The
  specified system class must inherit from this class.

  The specified system class was: <%= system %>
:system_unknown_type: |-
  The specified system type is unknown: <%= system %>. Please change this
  to a proper value.
:system_unspecified: |-
  A VM system type must be specified! This is done via the `config.vm.system`
  configuration value. Please read the documentation online for more information.
:vm_mount_fail: |-

:network_not_debian: |-
  Host only networking is only supported for Debian/Ubuntu by the built-in
  "Linux" system. If you're using some other distro and want to implement
  host only networking, please subclass the `Vagrant::Systems::Linux` class
  and implement the `prepare_host_only_network` and `enable_host_only_network`
  methods.

  Otherwise, please report your distro and how to modify network interfaces
  to the Vagrant mailing list or IRC and we'll probably be glad to add it
  to the internal systems.
