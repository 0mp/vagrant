# CATEGORY: Error Messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
:box_download_http_socket_error: |-
  An error occurred while trying to download the specified box. This most
  often happens if there is no internet connection or the address is
  invalid.

  Box URL: <%= box_url %>
:box_file_exists: |-
  The specified output file for packaging already exists. Please move
  the file or modify the output filename parameter then try to package
  again.

  Specified output file: <%= output_file %>
:box_remove_doesnt_exist: |-
  The box you're attempting to remove does not exist!
:box_repackage_doesnt_exist: |-
  The box you're attempting to repackage does not exist. Please check the
  name you specified and try again. As a reminder, the repackage
  command is for repackaging boxes which have been added through `vagrant box add`
  but the box has been lost.
:box_specified_doesnt_exist: |-
  Specified box `<%= box_name %>` does not exist!

  The box must be added through the `vagrant box add` command. Please view
  the documentation associated with the command for more information.
:box_not_specified: |-
  No base box was specified! A base box is required as a staring point
  for every vagrant virtual machine. Please specify one in your Vagrantfile
  using `config.vm.box`
:chef_base_invalid_provisioner: |-
  Vagrant::Provisioners::Chef is not a valid provisioner! Use ChefSolo or ChefServer instead.
:chef_server_url_required: |-
  Chef server provisioning requires that the `config.chef.chef_server_url` be set to the
  URL of your chef server. Examples include "http://12.12.12.12:4000" and
  "http://myserver.com:4000" (the port of course can be different, but 4000 is the default)
:chef_server_validation_key_required: |-
  Chef server provisioning requires that the `config.chef.validation_key_path` configuration
  be set to a path on your local machine of the validation key used to register the
  VM with the chef server.
:chef_server_validation_key_doesnt_exist: |-
  The validation key set for `config.chef.validation_key_path` does not exist! This
  file needs to exist so it can be uploaded to the virtual machine. It is
  currently set to "<%= Vagrant.config.chef.validation_key_path %>"
:chef_not_detected: |-
  The `<%= binary %>` binary appears to not be in the PATH of the guest. This
  could be because the PATH is not properly setup or perhaps chef is not
  installed on this guest. Chef provisioning can not continue without
  chef properly installed.
:command_box_invalid: |-
  Please specify a valid action to take on the boxes, either
  `add` or `remove`. Examples:

  vagrant box add name uri
  vagrant box remove name
  vagrant box list
:dotfile_error: |-
  The dotfile which Vagrant uses to store the UUID of the project's
  virtual machine already exists and is not a file! The dotfile is
  currently configured to be `<%= env.dotfile_path %>`

  To change this value, please see `config.vagrant.dotfile_name`

  Are you trying to use Vagrant from your home directory? This is the
  leading cause of this error message. To resolve this, simply use a
  different directory. Or, if you really want to run Vagrant from your
  home directory, modify the `config.vagrant.dotfile_name` configuration
  key.
:downloader_file_doesnt_exist: |-
  The given box does not exist on the file system:

  <%= source_url %>
:nfs_host_required: |-
  A host class is required for NFS shared folders. By default, these
  are auto-detected, but can be overriden with `config.vagrant.host`.
  There is currently not host class loaded.
:nfs_not_supported: |-
  The host class is reporting that NFS is not supported by this host,
  or `nfsd` may not be installed. Please verify that `nfsd` is installed
  on your machine, and retry.
:nfs_no_host_network: |-
  NFS shared folders requires that host only networking is enabled.
  Please enable host only networking via `config.vm.network`.
:network_not_found: |-
  The specified host network could not be found: <%= name %>.
  If the name specification is removed, Vagrant will create a new
  host only network for you. Alternatively, please create the
  specified network manually.
:network_collides: |-
  The specified host network collides with a non-hostonly network!
  This will cause your specified IP to be inaccessible. Please change
  the IP or name of your host only network to not match that of
  a bridged or non-hostonly network.
:package_include_file_doesnt_exist: |-
  File specified to include: '<%= filename %>' does not exist!
:package_output_exists: |-
  The specified file to save the package as already exists. Please
  remove this file or specify a different filename for outputting.
:package_requires_directory: |-
  A directory was not specified to package. This is an internal
  issue. Please send the relevant stack trace (if any) and information
  about this issue to the Vagrant team.
:package_requires_export: |-
  Package must be used in conjunction with export.
:provisioner_invalid_class: |-
  Provisioners must be an instance of Vagrant::Provisioners::Base
:provisioner_unknown_type: |-
  Unknown provisioner type: <%= provisioner %>
:ssh_bad_exit_status: |-
  The following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.
  Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed!

  <%= command %>
:system_invalid_class: |-
  The specified system does not inherit from `Vagrant::Systems::Base`. The
  specified system class must inherit from this class.

  The specified system class was: <%= system %>
:system_unknown_type: |-
  The specified system type is unknown: <%= system %>. Please change this
  to a proper value.
:system_unspecified: |-
  A VM system type must be specified! This is done via the `config.vm.system`
  configuration value. Please read the documentation online for more information.
:virtualbox_import_failure: |-
  The VM import failed! Try running `VBoxManage import` on the box file
  manually for more verbose error output.
:vm_failed_to_boot: |-
  Failed to connect to VM! Failed to boot?
:vm_port_auto_empty: |-
  Vagrant found a port collision for the specified port and virtual machine.
  While this port was marked to be auto-corrected, the ports in the
  auto-correction range are all also used.

  VM: <%= vm_name %>
  Forwarded port: <%= name %> (<%= options[:guestport] %> => <%= options[:hostport] %>)
:vm_port_below_threshold: |-
  The host port of all forwarded ports must be above 1024. VirtualBox
  does not allow host ports to be below 1024. (Guest ports below 1024
  are fine. For example: SSH on port 22 on the guest can be forwarded
  to port 2222, but not 222).
:vm_port_collision: |-
  Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they
  would collide with another VirtualBox virtual machine's forwarded
  ports! The "<%= name %>" forwarded port (<%= hostport %>) is already in use on the host
  machine.

  To fix this, modify your current projects Vagrantfile to use another
  port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:

  config.vm.forward_port("<%= name %>", <%= guestport %>, 1234)
:vm_power_off_to_package: |-
  The vagrant virtual environment you are trying to package must be powered off.
:vm_mount_fail: |-
  Failed to mount shared folders. vboxsf was not available.

# CATEGORY: Error Messages for Linux System
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
:network_not_debian: |-
  Host only networking is only supported for Debian/Ubuntu by the built-in
  "Linux" system. If you're using some other distro and want to implement
  host only networking, please subclass the `Vagrant::Systems::Linux` class
  and implement the `prepare_host_only_network` and `enable_host_only_network`
  methods.

  Otherwise, please report your distro and how to modify network interfaces
  to the Vagrant mailing list or IRC and we'll probably be glad to add it
  to the internal systems.
