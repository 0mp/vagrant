## 0.5.1 (unreleased)

  - Fixed error with doing a `vagrant up` when no Vagrantfile existed. [GH-128]
  - Fixed NFS erroring when NFS wasn't even enabled if `/etc/exports` doesn't
    exist. [GH-126]
  - Fixed `vagrant resume` to properly resume a suspended VM. [GH-122]
  - Fixed `halt`, `destroy`, `reload` to where they failed if the VM was
    in a saved state. [GH-123]
  - Added `config.chef.recipe_url` which allows you to specify a URL to
    a gzipped tar file for chef solo to download cookbooks. See the
    [chef-solo docs](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo#ChefSolo-RunningfromaURL) for more information.
    [GH-121]
  - Added `vagrant box repackage` which repackages boxes which have
    been added. This is useful in case you want to redistribute a base
    box you have but may have lost the actual "box" file. [GH-120]
