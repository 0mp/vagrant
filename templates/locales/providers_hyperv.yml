    errors:
      admin_required: |-
        The Hyper-V provider requires that Vagrant be run with
        administrative privileges. This is a limitation of Hyper-V itself.
        Hyper-V requires administrative privileges for management
        commands. Please restart your console with administrative
        privileges and try again.
      box_invalid: |-
        The box you're using with the Hyper-V provider ('%{name}')
        is invalid. A Hyper-V box should contain both a
        "Virtual Machines" and a "Virtual Hard Disks" folder that are
        created as part of exporting a Hyper-V machine.

        Within these directories, Vagrant expects to find the
        virtual machine configuration as well as the root hard disk.

        The box you're attempting to use is missing one or both of
        these directories or does not contain the files expected. Verify
        that you added the correct box. If this problem persists,
        please contact the creator of the box for assistance.
      powershell_error: |-

        is shown below. Please read the error message and see if this is
        a configuration error with your system. If it is not, then please
        report a bug.

      powershell_required: |-
        The Vagrant Hyper-V provider requires PowerShell to be available.
        Please make sure "powershell.exe" is available on your PATH.
      windows_required: |-
        The Hyper-V provider only works on Windows. Please try to
        use another provider.
